## 10 terms used among C programmers related to the Language:

### Pointer:
    A variable that stores the memory address 
    of another variable, allowing direct access 
    and manipulation of memory.

### Segmentation Fault: 
    A runtime error that occurs when a program 
    attempts to access memory it doesn't have
    permission to use.

### Structure (struct):
    A user-defined data type in C that groups 
    related variables of different types under 
    one name.

### Preprocessor Directive:
    Instructions beginning with # (e.g., #include, #define)
    that are executed before compilation to modidy the source
    code.

### Dynamic Memory Allocation:
    Memory allocation during runtime using functions
    like malloc, calloc, and free.

### Header File:
    A file with a .h extension containing declarations
    of functions, macros, or constants to be shared across
    multiple source files.

### Undefined Behavior (UB):
    Situation where the C standard does not define what
    should happen, often leading to unpredictable results
    or crashes.

### Macro:
    A fragment of code defined using #define that is 
    expanded by the preprocessor. Often used for constants
    or code snippets.

### Library:
    A collection of precompiled functions and code 
    (e.g., the Standard Library) that can be used to simplify
    programming tasks.

### Buffer Overflow:
    A security vulnerability that occurs when data exceed the 
    allocated buffer size, potentially overwriting adjacent 
    memory.

```c
int main() {
  int y = SOME_MACRO_REFERENCE;
  int x = 5 + 6;
  cout << "Hello World! " << x << std::endl();
}
```
