## 10 terms used among C programmers related to the Language:

### Pointer:
    A variable that stores the memory address 
    of another variable, allowing direct access 
    and manipulation of memory.

### Segmentation Fault: 
    A runtime error that occurs when a program 
    attempts to access memory it doesn't have
    permission to use.

### Structure (struct):
    A user-defined data type in C that groups 
    related variables of different types under 
    one name.

### Preprocessor Directive:
    Instructions beginning with # (e.g., #include, #define)
    that are executed before compilation to modidy the source
    code.

### Dynamic Memory Allocation:
    Memory allocation during runtime using functions
    like malloc, calloc, and free.

### Header File:
    A file with a .h extension containing declarations
    of functions, macros, or constants to be shared across
    multiple source files.

### Undefined Behavior (UB):
    Situation where the C standard does not define what
    should happen, often leading to unpredictable results
    or crashes.

### Macro:
    A fragment of code defined using #define that is 
    expanded by the preprocessor. Often used for constants
    or code snippets.

### Library:
    A collection of precompiled functions and code 
    (e.g., the Standard Library) that can be used to simplify
    programming tasks.

### Buffer Overflow:
    A security vulnerability that occurs when data exceed the 
    allocated buffer size, potentially overwriting adjacent 
    memory.

## 20 jargons related to C programming language:

### ABI (Application Binary Interface): 
    Defines how different program components or binaries
    interact at a machine code level.

### Alignment: 
    Ensures data is stored at memory addresses that are multiples
    of a specific value for performance optimization.

### Alias: 
    Refers to accessing the same memory location through
    different variable names or pointers.

### Big-Endian/Little-Endian:
    Refers to the order in which bytes are stored in memory
    for multi-byte data.

### Bitwise Operators: 
    Operators (&, |, ^, -, <<, >>) used for manipulating
    individual bits in variables.

### Casting:
    Explicitly converting a variable from one data type
    to another using syntax like (int)variable.

### Dangling Pointer: 
    A pointer that points to memory that has already been 
    deallocated.

### Dead Code:
    Code that is written but never executed in a program.

```c
int main() {
  int y = SOME_MACRO_REFERENCE;
  int x = 5 + 6;
  cout << "Hello World! " << x << std::endl();
}
```
