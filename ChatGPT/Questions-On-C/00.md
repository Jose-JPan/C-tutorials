## 10 terms used among C programmers related to the Language:

### Pointer:
    A variable that stores the memory address 
    of another variable, allowing direct access 
    and manipulation of memory.

```C
    #include <stdio.h>

// Function to swap two elements using pointers
void swap(int *a, int *b) {
    int temp = *a;   // Store the value of *a in temp
    *a = *b;         // Assign the value of *b to *a
    *b = temp;       // Assign the value of temp to *b
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int index1 = 1, index2 = 3;  // Swap the second and fourth elements

    printf("Before swap: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    }

    // Call swap with the addresses of the elements to swap
    swap(&arr[index1], &arr[index2]);

    printf("\nAfter swap: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}

```

### Segmentation Fault: 
    A runtime error that occurs when a program 
    attempts to access memory it doesn't have
    permission to use.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int *ptr; // Declare a pointer, but don't initialize it

    *ptr = 42; // Attempt to assign a value to the uninitialized pointer

    printf("Value: %d\n", *ptr); // Try to print the value
    return 0;
}
```

### Structure (struct):
    A user-defined data type in C that groups 
    related variables of different types under 
    one name.

### Preprocessor Directive:
    Instructions beginning with # (e.g., #include, #define)
    that are executed before compilation to modidy the source
    code.

### Dynamic Memory Allocation:
    Memory allocation during runtime using functions
    like malloc, calloc, and free.

### Header File:
    A file with a .h extension containing declarations
    of functions, macros, or constants to be shared across
    multiple source files.

### Undefined Behavior (UB):
    Situation where the C standard does not define what
    should happen, often leading to unpredictable results
    or crashes.

### Macro:
    A fragment of code defined using #define that is 
    expanded by the preprocessor. Often used for constants
    or code snippets.

### Library:
    A collection of precompiled functions and code 
    (e.g., the Standard Library) that can be used to simplify
    programming tasks.

### Buffer Overflow:
    A security vulnerability that occurs when data exceed the 
    allocated buffer size, potentially overwriting adjacent 
    memory.
```c
    #include <string.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    
    void vulnerable_function() {
        char buffer[10];
        strcpy(buffer, "This string is way too long!");
        printf("Buffer contains: %s\n", buffer);
    }

    int main() {
        vulnerable_function();
        return 0;
    }

```

## 20 jargons related to C programming language:

### ABI (Application Binary Interface): 
    Defines how different program components or binaries
    interact at a machine code level.

### Alignment: 
    Ensures data is stored at memory addresses that are multiples
    of a specific value for performance optimization.

### Alias: 
    Refers to accessing the same memory location through
    different variable names or pointers.

### Big-Endian / Little-Endian:
    Refers to the order in which bytes are stored in memory
    for multi-byte data.

### Bitwise Operators: 
    Operators (&, |, ^, -, <<, >>) used for manipulating
    individual bits in variables.

### Casting:
    Explicitly converting a variable from one data type
    to another using syntax like (int)variable.

### Dangling Pointer: 
    A pointer that points to memory that has already been 
    deallocated.

### Dead Code:
    Code that is written but never executed in a program.

### Dereferencing:
    Accessing the value stored at the memory address a pointer
    points to using *.

### Double-Free:
    A bug that occurs when free() is called on the same 
    memory address more than once.

### Enum (Enumeration):
    A user-defined data type consisting of a set of named
    integer constants.

### Function Pointer:
    A pointer that stores the address of a function, enabling 
    dynamic invocation of functions.

### Garbage Value: 
    An uninitialized variables that contains random data.

### Heap:
    A region of memory used for dynamic memory allocation
    during runtime.

### Inline Function:
    A function defined with the inline keyword to suggest
    replacing function calls with actual code to improve
    performance.

### Reentrant Function:
    A function that can be safely called simultaneously from 
    multiple threads.

### Segmentation Fault (Segfault):
    An error caused by accessing memory that the program
    doesn't have permission to use.

### Static Variables:
    A variable declared with the static keyword that retains
    its value across function calls.

### Token: 
    The smallest unit in a C program, such as keywords,
    identifiers, literals, operators, and separators.

### Volatile: 
    A keyword indicating that a variable's value may change
    unexpectedly, such as in multi-threaded environments 
    or hardware registers.

```c
int main() {
  int y = SOME_MACRO_REFERENCE;
  int x = 5 + 6;
  cout << "Hello World! " << x << std::endl();
}
```
