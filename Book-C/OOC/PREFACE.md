# The Beggining

## Preface
    1 No programming technique solves all problems 
    2 No programming language produces only correct results 
    3 No programmer should start each project from scratch 
    
    Object-oriented programming is the current cure-all - althoug it has been
    around for much more than ten years. At the core, there is little more to it than
    finally applying the good programming principles which we have been taught for 
    more than twenty years. C++ (Eiffel, Oberon-2, Smalltalk... take your pick) is the
    New Language because it is object-oriented - although you need not use it that 
    way if you do not want to (or know how to), and it turns out that you can do just
    as well with plain ANSI-C. Only object-orientation permits code reuse between
    projects -- Although the idea of subroutines is as old as computers and good programmers always carried their toolkits and libraries with them.
