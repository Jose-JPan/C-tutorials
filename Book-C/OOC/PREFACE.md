# Preface
## The beginning
    1 No programming technique solves all problems 
    2 No programming language produces only correct results 
    3 No programmer should start each project from scratch 
## (OOP)    
    Object-oriented programming is the current cure-all - althoug it has been
    around for much more than ten years. At the core, there is little more to it than
    finally applying the good programming principles which we have been taught for 
    more than twenty years. C++ (Eiffel, Oberon-2, Smalltalk... take your pick) is the
    New Language because it is object-oriented - although you need not use it that 
    way if you do not want to (or know how to), and it turns out that you can do just
    as well with plain ANSI-C. Only object-orientation permits code reuse between
    projects -- Although the idea of subroutines is as old as computers and good 
    programmers always carried their toolkits and libraries with them.

## About the book
    This book is not going to praise object-oriented programming or condemn the Old 
    Way. We are simply going to use ANSI-C to discover how object-oriented programming
    is done, what its techniques are, why they help us solve bigger problems, and how 
    we generality and program to catch mistakes earlier. Along the way we encounter
    all the jargon - classes, inheritance, instances, linkage, methods, objects, 
    polymorphisms, and more - but we take it out of the realm of magic and see how it 
    translates into the things we have known and done all along.

## Nice Discovery
    I had fun discovering that ANSI-C is a full-scale object-oriented language.
    To share this fun you need to be reasonably fluent in ANSI-C to begin with -- 
    feeling comfortable with structure, pointers, prototypes, and function pointers is
    a must. Working through the book you will encounter all the newspeak -- according 
    to Orwell and Webster a language "designed to diminish the range of thought" -- 
    and I will try to demonstrate how it merely combines all the good programming 
    principles that you always wanted to employ into a coherent approach. As a result
    you may will become a more proficiente ANSI-C programmer. 

## Chapters
    The first six chapters develop the fundations of object-oriented programming with
    ANSI-C. We start with a careful information hiding technique for abstract data 
    types, add generic functions based on dynamic linkage and inherit code by 
    judicious lengthening of structures. Finally, we put it all together in a class
    hierarchy that makes code much easier to maintain.
