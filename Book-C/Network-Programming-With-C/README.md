# Hands-On Network Programming with C

 A comprehensive guide to programming with network sockets, 
 implementing internet protocols, designing IoT devices, and
 much more with CKey Features

 * Apply your C and C++ programming skills to build powerful
   network applications
 
 * Get to grips with a variety of network protocols that allow 
   you to load web pages, send emails, and do much more

 * Write portable network code for Windows, Linux, and macOSBook
   Description

 Network programming enables processes to communicate with each
 other over a computer network, but it is a complex task that 
 requires programming with multiple libraries and protocols.
 With its support for third-party libraries and structured
 documentation, C is an ideal language to write network programs.

 Complete with step-by-step explanations of essential concepts 
 and practical examples, this C network programming book begins
 with the fundamentals of Internet Protocol, TCP, and UDP. You'll
 explore client-server and peer-to-peer models for information sharing
 and connectivity with remote computers. The book will
 also cover HTTP and HTTPS for communicating between your browser
 and website, and delve into hostname web. As you  advance, you'll
 gain insights into asynchronous socket programming and streams,
 and explore debugging and error handling. Finally, you'll study 
 network monitoring and implement security best practices. 

 By the end of this book, you'll have experience of working with
 client-server applications and be able to implement new network
 programs in C.

 The code in this book is compatible with the older C99 version
 as well as the latest C18 and C++17 standards. You'll work with 
 robust, reliable, and secure code that is portable across operating
 systems, including Winsock sockets for Windows and POSIX sockets 
 for Linux and macOS. What you will learn:

 * Uncover cross-platform socket programming APIs 
 * Implement techniques for supporting IPv4 and IPv6
 * Understand how TCP and UDP connections work over IP
 * Discover how hostname resolution and DNS work
 * Interface with web APIs using HTTP and HTTPS
 * Explore Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) for electronic mail transmission
 * Apply network programming to the Internet of Things (IoT)

  Who this book is for:
  * If you're a developer or a system administrator who whats to get
  started with network programming, this book is for you. Basic
  knowledge of C programming is assumed.
