### What This Book Covers
    
 ## Chapter 1: Working with Arrays, covers some complex but essential operations with
    arrays. You will learn how to insert an element into an array, multiply two matrices,
    find the common elements in two arrays, and also how to find the difference between
    two sets or arrays. Also, you will learn how to find the unique elements in an array
    and will encounter a technique to help you find out whether a given matrix is a sparse
    matrix or not. Lastly, we'll look at the procedure to merge two sorted arrays into one 
    array.

## Chapter 2: Managing Strings, teaches you how to manipulate strings to the extent of 
    characters. You will learn how to find out whether a given string is a palindrome or
    not, how to find a given occurrence of the first repetitive character in a string, and 
    how to count each character in a string. You will also learn how to count vowels and
    consonants in a string and the procedure for converting the vowels in a sentence into
    uppercase.

## Chapter 3: Exploring Functions, explores the major role played by functions in
    breaking down a big application into small, independent, and manageable modules.
    In this chapter, you will learn to make a function that finds whether the supplied
    argument is an Armstrong number or not. You will also learn how a function returns
    an array and will make a function that finds the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 
    two numbers using recursion. You will also learn to make functions that convert a 
    binary number into hexadecimal. Lastly, you will learn to make a function that 
    determines whether the supplied number is a palindrome or not.
