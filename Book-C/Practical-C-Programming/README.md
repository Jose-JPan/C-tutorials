# PRACTICAL C PROGRAMMIG

 A Comprehensive guide with practical instructions for learning
 data structures, low-level programming, high-performance computing,
 networking and IoT to help you understand the latest standards in C
 programming such as C11 and C18 Key Features.

 * Tackle various challenges in C programming by making the most of
   its latest features.                   
 * Understand the working of arrays, strings, functions, pointers,
   advanced data structures, and algorithms
 * Become well-versed with process synchronization during multi-
   tasking and server-client process communication Book Description.

 Used in everything from microcontrollers to operating systems, C is 
 a popular programming language among developers because of its flexibi-
 lity and versatility. This book helps you get hands-on with various
 tasks, covering the fundamental as well as complex C programming concepts
 that are essential for making real-life applications.

 You'll start with recipes for arrays, strings, user-defined functions,
 and pre-processing directives. Once you're familiar with the basic
 features, you'll gradually move on to learning pointers, file handling,
 concurrency, networking, and inter-process communication (IPC).

 The book then illustrastes how to carry out searching and arrange data
 using different sorting techniques, before demonstrating the implementa-
 tion of data structures such as stacks and queues. Later, you'll learn
 interesting programming features such as using graphics for drawing and
 animation, and the application of general-purpose utilities. Finally, 
 the book will take you through advanced concepts such as low-level pro-
 gramming, embedded software, IoT, and security in coding, as well as
 techniques for improving code performance.

 By the end of this book, you'll have a clear understanding of C pro-
 gramming, and have the skills you need to develop robust apps.

 What you will learn:
  * Discover how to use arrays, functions, and strings to make large
    applications.
  * Perform preprocessing and conditional compilation for efficient
    programming.
  * Understand how to use pointers and memory optimally.
  * Use general-purpose utilities and improve code performance.
  * Implement multitasking using threads and process synchronization.
  * Use low-level programming and the inline assembly language.
  * Understand how to use graphics for animation
  * Get to grips with applying security while developing C programs

 Who this book is for:
  * This intermediate-level book is for developers who want to become
    better C programmers by learning its modern features and programming
    practices. Familiarity with C programming is assumed to get the 
    most out of this book.
